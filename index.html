            I love coding! I currently work as a platform engineer at a sports experience company here in Pittsburgh,
            PA!
            I enjoy going for walks with my wife, playing video games, and coding on side projects! Most of my time is
            devoted to school or working right now, so I have not had much time for my side projects.
            My wife and I have been married for about 18 months now,
            and I can clearly say life without her does not make sense anymore.
            I can still remember the spirit that was present in the temple when we were being sealed together forever.
            I work as a platform engineer throughout the week and I LOVE to code whenever I can!
            I usually do backend, logic and automation so this class is stretching what I am good at.
            I think most engineers should be constantly trying to learn and grow their skills at every level, both front
            end and back end.
            If you ever get the chance to learn anything with AI it is super fun stuff! I work with a lot of AI search
            right now in my current project.
            If you ever have questions use teams to reach out to me!
            I am excited to see what the future holds for me!

            This is my home, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
            I live in a very green region with rolling hills as far as the eye can see.
            It is truly beautiful here. I would like to live here my entire life!
