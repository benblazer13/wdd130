        <p>
            I love coding! I currently work as a platform engineer at a sports experience company here in Pittsburgh,
            PA!
            I enjoy going for walks with my wife, playing video games, and coding on side projects! Most of my time is
            devoted to school or working right now, so I have not had much time for my side projects. I am excited to
            see what the future holds for me!

            This is my home, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.
            I live in a very green region with rolling hills as far as the eye can see.
            It is truly beautiful here. I would like to live here my entire life!
